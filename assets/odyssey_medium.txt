tell me o muse of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of troy many cities did he visit and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home but do what he might he could not save his men for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the sungod hyperion so the god prevented them from ever reaching home tell me too about all these things oh daughter of jove from whatsoever source you may know them
so now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except ulysses and he though he was longing to return to his wife and country was detained by the goddess calypso who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him but as years went by there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to ithaca even then however when he was among his own people his troubles were not yet over nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except neptune who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home
now neptune had gone off to the ethiopians who are at the worlds end and lie in two halves the one looking west and the other east he had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen and was enjoying himself at his festival but the other gods met in the house of olympian jove and the sire of gods and men spoke first at that moment he was thinking of aegisthus who had been killed by agamemnons son orestes so he said to the other gods
see now how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but their own folly look at aegisthus he must needs make love to agamemnons wife unrighteously and then kill agamemnon though he knew it would be the death of him for i sent mercury to warn him not to do either of these things inasmuch as orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen and now he has paid for everything in full

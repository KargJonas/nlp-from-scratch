tell me o muse of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of troy many cities did he visit and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home but do what he might he could not save his men for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the sungod hyperion so the god prevented them from ever reaching home tell me too about all these things oh daughter of jove from whatsoever source you may know them
so now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except ulysses and he though he was longing to return to his wife and country was detained by the goddess calypso who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him but as years went by there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to ithaca even then however when he was among his own people his troubles were not yet over nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except neptune who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home
now neptune had gone off to the ethiopians who are at the worlds end and lie in two halves the one looking west and the other east he had gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen and was enjoying himself at his festival but the other gods met in the house of olympian jove and the sire of gods and men spoke first at that moment he was thinking of aegisthus who had been killed by agamemnons son orestes so he said to the other gods
see now how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing but their own folly look at aegisthus he must needs make love to agamemnons wife unrighteously and then kill agamemnon though he knew it would be the death of him for i sent mercury to warn him not to do either of these things inasmuch as orestes would be sure to take his revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home mercury told him this in all good will but he would not listen and now he has paid for everything in full
then minerva said father son of saturn king of kings it served aegisthus right and so it would any one else who does as he did but aegisthus is neither here nor there it is for ulysses that my heart bleeds when i think of his sufferings in that lonely seagirt island far away poor man from all his friends it is an island covered with forest in the very middle of the sea and a goddess lives there daughter of the magician atlas who looks after the bottom of the ocean and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth asunder this daughter of atlas has got hold of poor unhappy ulysses and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his home so that he is tired of life and thinks of nothing but how he may once more see the smoke of his own chimneys you sir take no heed of this and yet when ulysses was before troy did he not propitiate you with many a burnt sacrifice why then should you keep on being so angry with him
and jove said my child what are you talking about how can i forget ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth nor more liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven bear in mind however that neptune is still furious with ulysses for having blinded an eye of polyphemus king of the cyclopes polyphemus is son to neptune by the nymph thoosa daughter to the seaking phorcys therefore though he will not kill ulysses outright he torments him by preventing him from getting home still let us lay our heads together and see how we can help him to return neptune will then be pacified for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us
and minerva said father son of saturn king of kings if then the gods now mean that ulysses should get home we should first send mercury to the ogygian island to tell calypso that we have made up our minds and that he is to return in the meantime i will go to ithaca to put heart into ulysses son telemachus i will embolden him to call the achaeans in assembly and speak out to the suitors of his mother penelope who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen i will also conduct him to sparta and to pylos to see if he can hear anything about the return of his dear fatherfor this will make people speak well of him
so saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals imperishable with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea she grasped the redoubtable bronzeshod spear so stout and sturdy and strong wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her and down she darted from the topmost summits of olympus whereon forthwith she was in ithaca at the gateway of ulysses house disguised as a visitor mentes chief of the taphians and she held a bronze spear in her hand there she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the oxen which they had killed and eaten and playing draughts in front of the house menservants and pages were bustling about to wait upon them some mixing wine with water in the mixingbowls some cleaning down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again and some cutting up great quantities of meat
telemachus saw her long before any one else did he was sitting moodily among the suitors thinking about his brave father and how he would send them flying out of the house if he were to come to his own again and be honoured as in days gone by thus brooding as he sat among them he caught sight of minerva and went straight to the gate for he was vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance he took her right hand in his own and bade her give him her spear welcome said he to our house and when you have partaken of food you shall tell us what you have come for
he led the way as he spoke and minerva followed him when they were within he took her spear and set it in the spearstand against a strong bearingpost along with the many other spears of his unhappy father and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a cloth of damask there was a footstool also for her feet and he set another seat near her for himself away from the suitors that she might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence and that he might ask her more freely about his father
a maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands and she drew a clean table beside them an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold by their side and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for them
then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and seats forthwith men servants poured water over their hands maids went round with the breadbaskets pages filled the mixingbowls with wine and water and they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they wanted music and dancing which are the crowning embellishments of a banquet so a servant brought a lyre to phemius whom they compelled perforce to sing to them as soon as he touched his lyre and began to sing telemachus spoke low to minerva with his head close to hers that no man might hear
i hope sir said he that you will not be offended with what i am going to say singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it and all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf if these men were to see my father come back to ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather than a longer purse for money would not serve them but he alas has fallen on an ill fate and even when people do sometimes say that he is coming we no longer heed them we shall never see him again and now sir tell me and tell me true who you are and where you come from tell me of your town and parents what manner of ship you came in how your crew brought you to ithaca and of what nation they declared themselves to befor you cannot have come by land tell me also truly for i want to know are you a stranger to this house or have you been here in my fathers time in the old days we had many visitors for my father went about much himself
and minerva answered i will tell you truly and particularly all about it i am mentes son of anchialus and i am king of the taphians i have come here with my ship and crew on a voyage to men of a foreign tongue being bound for temesa with a cargo of iron and i shall bring back copper as for my ship it lies over yonder off the open country away from the town in the harbour rheithron under the wooded mountain neritum our fathers were friends before us as old laertes will tell you if you will go and ask him they say however that he never comes to town now and lives by himself in the country faring hardly with an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him when he comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard they told me your father was at home again and that was why i came but it seems the gods are still keeping him back for he is not dead yet not on the mainland it is more likely he is on some seagirt island in mid ocean or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will i am no prophet and know very little about omens but i speak as it is borne in upon me from heaven and assure you that he will not be away much longer for he is a man of such resource that even though he were in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again but tell me and tell me true can ulysses really have such a fine looking fellow for a son you are indeed wonderfully like him about the head and eyes for we were close friends before he set sail for troy where the flower of all the argives went also since that time we have never either of us seen the other
my mother answered telemachus tells me i am son to ulysses but it is a wise child that knows his own father would that i were son to one who had grown old upon his own estates for since you ask me there is no more illstarred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my father
and minerva said there is no fear of your race dying out yet while penelope has such a fine son as you are but tell me and tell me true what is the meaning of all this feasting and who are these people what is it all about have you some banquet or is there a wedding in the familyfor no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own and the guestshow atrociously they are behaving what riot they make over the whole house it is enough to disgust any respectable person who comes near them
sir said telemachus as regards your question so long as my father was here it was well with us and with the house but the gods in their displeasure have willed it otherwise and have hidden him away more closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden i could have borne it better even though he were dead if he had fallen with his men before troy or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done for then the achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and i should myself have been heir to his renown but now the stormwinds have spirited him away we know not whither he is gone without leaving so much as a trace behind him and i inherit nothing but dismay nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of my father heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind for the chiefs from all our islands dulichium same and the woodland island of zacynthus as also all the principal men of ithaca itself are eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my mother who will neither point blank say that she will not marry nor yet bring matters to an end so they are making havoc of my estate and before long will do so also with myself
is that so exclaimed minerva then you do indeed want ulysses home again give him his helmet shield and a couple of lances and if he is the man he was when i first knew him in our house drinking and making merry he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors were he to stand once more upon his own threshold he was then coming from ephyra where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from ilus son of mermerus ilus feared the everliving gods and would not give him any but my father let him have some for he was very fond of him if ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short shrift and a sorry wedding
but there it rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return and take his revenge in his own house or no i would however urge you to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once take my advice call the achaean heroes in assembly tomorrow morninglay your case before them and call heaven to bear you witness bid the suitors take themselves off each to his own place and if your mothers mind is set on marrying again let her go back to her father who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear a daughter may expect as for yourself let me prevail upon you to take the best ship you can get with a crew of twenty men and go in quest of your father who has so long been missing some one may tell you something or and people often hear things in this way some heavensent message may direct you first go to pylos and ask nestor thence go on to sparta and visit menelaus for he got home last of all the achaeans if you hear that your father is alive and on his way home you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet another twelve months if on the other hand you hear of his death come home at once celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp build a barrow to his memory and make your mother marry again then having done all this think it well over in your mind how by fair means or foul you may kill these suitors in your own house you are too old to plead infancy any longer have you not heard how people are singing orestes praises for having killed his fathers murderer aegisthus you are a fine smart looking fellow show your mettle then and make yourself a name in story now however i must go back to my ship and to my crew who will be impatient if i keep them waiting longer think the matter over for yourself and remember what i have said to you
sir answered telemachus it has been very kind of you to talk to me in this way as though i were your own son and i will do all you tell me i know you want to be getting on with your voyage but stay a little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself i will then give you a present and you shall go on your way rejoicing i will give you one of great beauty and valuea keepsake such as only dear friends give to one another
minerva answered do not try to keep me for i would be on my way at once as for any present you may be disposed to make me keep it till i come again and i will take it home with me you shall give me a very good one and i will give you one of no less value in return
with these words she flew away like a bird into the air but she had given telemachus courage and had made him think more than ever about his father he felt the change wondered at it and knew that the stranger had been a god so he went straight to where the suitors were sitting
phemius was still singing and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he told the sad tale of the return from troy and the ills minerva had laid upon the achaeans penelope daughter of icarius heard his song from her room upstairs and came down by the great staircase not alone but attended by two of her handmaids when she reached the suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof of the cloisters with a staid maiden on either side of her she held a veil moreover before her face and was weeping bitterly
phemius she cried you know many another feat of gods and heroes such as poets love to celebrate sing the suitors some one of these and let them drink their wine in silence but cease this sad tale for it breaks my sorrowful heart and reminds me of my lost husband whom i mourn ever without ceasing and whose name was great over all hellas and middle argos
mother answered telemachus let the bard sing what he has a mind to bards do not make the ills they sing of it is jove not they who makes them and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own good pleasure this fellow means no harm by singing the illfated return of the danaans for people always applaud the latest songs most warmly make up your mind to it and bear it ulysses is not the only man who never came back from troy but many another went down as well as he go then within the house and busy yourself with your daily duties your loom your distaff and the ordering of your servants for speech is mans matter and mine above all others for it is i who am master here
she went wondering back into the house and laid her sons saying in her heart then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room she mourned her dear husband till minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes but the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters and prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow
then telemachus spoke shameless he cried and insolent suitors let us feast at our pleasure now and let there be no brawling for it is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as phemius has but in the morning meet me in full assembly that i may give you formal notice to depart and feast at one anothers houses turn and turn about at your own cost if on the other hand you choose to persist in spunging upon one man heaven help me but jove shall reckon with you in full and when you fall in my fathers house there shall be no man to avenge you
the suitors bit their lips as they heard him and marvelled at the boldness of his speech then antinous son of eupeithes said the gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking may jove never grant you to be chief in ithaca as your father was before you
telemachus answered antinous do not chide with me but god willing i will be chief too if i can is this the worst fate you can think of for me it is no bad thing to be a chief for it brings both riches and honour still now that ulysses is dead there are many great men in ithaca both old and young and some other may take the lead among them nevertheless i will be chief in my own house and will rule those whom ulysses has won for me
then eurymachus son of polybus answered it rests with heaven to decide who shall be chief among us but you shall be master in your own house and over your own possessions no one while there is a man in ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you and now my good fellow i want to know about this stranger what country does he come from of what family is he and where is his estate has he brought you news about the return of your father or was he on business of his own he seemed a well to do man but he hurried off so suddenly that he was gone in a moment before we could get to know him
my father is dead and gone answered telemachus and even if some rumour reaches me i put no more faith in it now my mother does indeed sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him but i give his prophecyings no heed as for the stranger he was mentes son of anchialus chief of the taphians an old friend of my fathers but in his heart he knew that it had been the goddess
the suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the evening but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to bed each in his own abode telemachuss room was high up in a tower that looked on to the outer court hither then he hied brooding and full of thought a good old woman euryclea daughter of ops the son of pisenor went before him with a couple of blazing torches laertes had bought her with his own money when she was quite young he gave the worth of twenty oxen for her and shewed as much respect to her in his household as he did to his own wedded wife but he did not take her to his bed for he feared his wifes resentment she it was who now lighted telemachus to his room and she loved him better than any of the other women in the house did for she had nursed him when he was a baby he opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed as he took off his shirt he gave it to the good old woman who folded it tidily up and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side after which she went out pulled the door to by a silver catch and drew the bolt home by means of the strap but telemachus as he lay covered with a woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage and of the counsel that minerva had given him
assembly of the people of ithacaspeeches of telemachus and of the suitorstelemachus makes his preparations and starts for pylos with minerva disguised as mentor
now when the child of morning rosyfingered dawn appeared telemachus rose and dressed himself he bound his sandals on to his comely feet girded his sword about his shoulder and left his room looking like an immortal god he at once sent the criers round to call the people in assembly so they called them and the people gathered thereon then when they were got together he went to the place of assembly spear in handnot alone for his two hounds went with him minerva endowed him with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went by and when he took his place in his fathers seat even the oldest councillors made way for him
aegyptius a man bent float with age and of infinite experience was the first to speak his son antiphus had gone with ulysses to ilius land of noble steeds but the savage cyclops had killed him when they were all shut up in the cave and had cooked his last dinner for him he had three sons left of whom two still worked on their fathers land while the third eurynomus was one of the suitors nevertheless their father could not get over the loss of antiphus and was still weeping for him when he began his speech
men of ithaca he said hear my words from the day ulysses left us there has been no meeting of our councillors until now who then can it be whether old or young that finds it so necessary to convene us has he got wind of some host approaching and does he wish to warn us or would he speak upon some other matter of public moment i am sure he is an excellent person and i hope jove will grant him his hearts desire
telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once for he was bursting with what he had to say he stood in the middle of the assembly and the good herald pisenor brought him his staff then turning to aegyptius sir said he it is i as you will shortly learn who have convened you for it is i who am the most aggrieved i have not got wind of any host approaching about which i would warn you nor is there any matter of public moment on which i would speak my grievance is purely personal and turns on two great misfortunes which have fallen upon my house the first of these is the loss of my excellent father who was chief among all you here present and was like a father to every one of you the second is much more serious and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate the sons of all the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will they are afraid to go to her father icarius asking him to choose the one he likes best and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter but day by day they keep hanging about my fathers house sacrificing our oxen sheep and fat goats for their banquets and never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink no estate can stand such recklessness we have now no ulysses to ward off harm from our doors and i cannot hold my own against them i shall never all my days be as good a man as he was still i would indeed defend myself if i had power to do so for i cannot stand such treatment any longer my house is being disgraced and ruined have respect therefore to your own consciences and to public opinion fear too the wrath of heaven lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you i pray you by jove and themis who is the beginning and the end of councils do not hold back my friends and leave me singlehandedunless it be that my brave father ulysses did some wrong to the achaeans which you would now avenge on me by aiding and abetting these suitors moreover if i am to be eaten out of house and home at all i had rather you did the eating yourselves for i could then take action against you to some purpose and serve you with notices from house to house till i got paid in full whereas now i have no remedy
with this telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears every one was very sorry for him but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer save only antinous who spoke thus
telemachus insolent braggart that you are how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors it is your mothers fault not ours for she is a very artful woman this three years past and close on four she had been driving us out of our minds by encouraging each one of us and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says and then there was that other trick she played us she set up a great tambour frame in her room and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework sweet hearts said she ulysses is indeed dead still do not press me to marry again immediately waitfor i would not have skill in needlework perish unrecordedtill i have completed a pall for the hero laertes to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him he is very rich and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall
this was what she said and we assented whereon we could see her working on her great web all day long but at night she would unpick the stitches again by torchlight she fooled us in this way for three years and we never found her out but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth year one of her maids who knew what she was doing told us and we caught her in the act of undoing her work so she had to finish it whether she would or no the suitors therefore make you this answer that both you and the achaeans may understandsend your mother away and bid her marry the man of her own and of her fathers choice for i do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the accomplishments minerva has taught her and because she is so clever we never yet heard of such a woman we know all about tyro alcmena mycene and the famous women of old but they were nothing to your mother any one of them it was not fair of her to treat us in that way and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now endowed her so long shall we go on eating up your estate and i do not see why she should change for she gets all the honour and glory and it is you who pay for it not she understand then that we will not go back to our lands neither here nor elsewhere till she has made her choice and married some one or other of us
telemachus answered antinous how can i drive the mother who bore me from my fathers house my father is abroad and we do not know whether he is alive or dead it will be hard on me if i have to pay icarius the large sum which i must give him if i insist on sending his daughter back to him not only will he deal rigorously with me but heaven will also punish me for my mother when she leaves the house will call on the erinyes to avenge her besides it would not be a creditable thing to do and i will have nothing to say to it if you choose to take offence at this leave the house and feast elsewhere at one anothers houses at your own cost turn and turn about if on the other hand you elect to persist in spunging upon one man heaven help me but jove shall reckon with you in full and when you fall in my fathers house there shall be no man to avenge you
as he spoke jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain and they flew on and on with the wind sailing side by side in their own lordly flight when they were right over the middle of the assembly they wheeled and circled about beating the air with their wings and glaring death into the eyes of them that were below then fighting fiercely and tearing at one another they flew off towards the right over the town the people wondered as they saw them and asked each other what all this might be whereon halitherses who was the best prophet and reader of omens among them spoke to them plainly and in all honesty saying
hear me men of ithaca and i speak more particularly to the suitors for i see mischief brewing for them ulysses is not going to be away much longer indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and destruction not on them alone but on many another of us who live in ithaca let us then be wise in time and put a stop to this wickedness before he comes let the suitors do so of their own accord it will be better for them for i am not prophesying without due knowledge everything has happened to ulysses as i foretold when the argives set out for troy and he with them i said that after going through much hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the twentieth year and that no one would know him and now all this is coming true
eurymachus son of polybus then said go home old man and prophesy to your own children or it may be worse for them i can read these omens myself much better than you can birds are always flying about in the sunshine somewhere or other but they seldom mean anything ulysses has died in a far country and it is a pity you are not dead along with him instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger of telemachus which is fierce enough as it is i suppose you think he will give you something for your family but i tell youand it shall surely bewhen an old man like you who should know better talks a young one over till he becomes troublesome in the first place his young friend will only fare so much the worsehe will take nothing by it for the suitors will prevent thisand in the next we will lay a heavier fine sir upon yourself than you will at all like paying for it will bear hardly upon you as for telemachus i warn him in the presence of you all to send his mother back to her father who will find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear a daughter may expect till then we shall go on harassing him with our suit for we fear no man and care neither for him with all his fine speeches nor for any fortunetelling of yours you may preach as much as you please but we shall only hate you the more we shall go back and continue to eat up telemachuss estate without paying him till such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day after day on the tiptoe of expectation each vying with the other in his suit for a prize of such rare perfection besides we cannot go after the other women whom we should marry in due course but for the way in which she treats us
then telemachus said eurymachus and you other suitors i shall say no more and entreat you no further for the gods and the people of ithaca now know my story give me then a ship and a crew of twenty men to take me hither and thither and i will go to sparta and to pylos in quest of my father who has so long been missing some one may tell me something or and people often hear things in this way some heavensent message may direct me if i can hear of him as alive and on his way home i will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet another twelve months if on the other hand i hear of his death i will return at once celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp build a barrow to his memory and make my mother marry again
with these words he sat down and mentor who had been a friend of ulysses and had been left in charge of everything with full authority over the servants rose to speak he then plainly and in all honesty addressed them thus
hear me men of ithaca i hope that you may never have a kind and welldisposed ruler any more nor one who will govern you equitably i hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust for there is not one of you but has forgotten ulysses who ruled you as though he were your father i am not half so angry with the suitors for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts and wager their heads that ulysses will not return they can take the high hand and eat up his estate but as for you others i am shocked at the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such scandalous goings onwhich you could do if you chose for you are many and they are few
leiocritus son of evenor answered him saying mentor what folly is all this that you should set the people to stay us it is a hard thing for one man to fight with many about his victuals even though ulysses himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house and do his best to oust us his wife who wants him back so very badly would have small cause for rejoicing and his blood would be upon his own head if he fought against such great odds there is no sense in what you have been saying now therefore do you people go about your business and let his fathers old friends mentor and halitherses speed this boy on his journey if he goes at allwhich i do not think he will for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes and tells him something
on this he broke up the assembly and every man went back to his own abode while the suitors returned to the house of ulysses
then telemachus went all alone by the sea side washed his hands in the grey waves and prayed to minerva
hear me he cried you god who visited me yesterday and bade me sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing i would obey you but the achaeans and more particularly the wicked suitors are hindering me that i cannot do so
as he thus prayed minerva came close up to him in the likeness and with the voice of mentor telemachus said she if you are made of the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward henceforward for ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half done if then you take after him your voyage will not be fruitless but unless you have the blood of ulysses and of penelope in your veins i see no likelihood of your succeeding sons are seldom as good men as their fathers they are generally worse not better still as you are not going to be either fool or coward henceforward and are not entirely without some share of your fathers wise discernment i look with hope upon your undertaking but mind you never make common cause with any of those foolish suitors for they have neither sense nor virtue and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly fall on one and all of them so that they shall perish on the same day as for your voyage it shall not be long delayed your father was such an old friend of mine that i will find you a ship and will come with you myself now however return home and go about among the suitors begin getting provisions ready for your voyage see everything well stowed the wine in jars and the barley meal which is the staff of life in leathern bags while i go round the town and beat up volunteers at once there are many ships in ithaca both old and new i will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best we will get her ready and will put out to sea without delay
thus spoke minerva daughter of jove and telemachus lost no time in doing as the goddess told him he went moodily home and found the suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court antinous came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own saying telemachus my fine fireeater bear no more ill blood neither in word nor deed but eat and drink with us as you used to do the achaeans will find you in everythinga ship and a picked crew to bootso that you can set sail for pylos at once and get news of your noble father
antinous answered telemachus i cannot eat in peace nor take pleasure of any kind with such men as you are was it not enough that you should waste so much good property of mine while i was yet a boy now that i am older and know more about it i am also stronger and whether here among this people or by going to pylos i will do you all the harm i can i shall go and my going will not be in vainthough thanks to you suitors i have neither ship nor crew of my own and must be passenger not captain
as he spoke he snatched his hand from that of antinous meanwhile the others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings jeering at him tauntingly as they did so
telemachus said one youngster means to be the death of us i suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from pylos or again from sparta where he seems bent on going or will he go to ephyra as well for poison to put in our wine and kill us
another said perhaps if telemachus goes on board ship he will be like his father and perish far from his friends in this case we should have plenty to do for we could then divide up his property amongst us as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have that
this was how they talked but telemachus went down into the lofty and spacious storeroom where his fathers treasure of gold and bronze lay heaped up upon the floor and where the linen and spare clothes were kept in open chests here too there was a store of fragrant olive oil while casks of old wellripened wine unblended and fit for a god to drink were ranged against the wall in case ulysses should come home again after all the room was closed with wellmade doors opening in the middle moreover the faithful old housekeeper euryclea daughter of ops the son of pisenor was in charge of everything both night and day telemachus called her to the storeroom and said
nurse draw me off some of the best wine you have after what you are keeping for my fathers own drinking in case poor man he should escape death and find his way home again after all let me have twelve jars and see that they all have lids also fill me some wellsewn leathern bags with barley mealabout twenty measures in all get these things put together at once and say nothing about it i will take everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for the night i am going to sparta and to pylos to see if i can hear anything about the return of my dear father
when euryclea heard this she began to cry and spoke fondly to him saying my dear child what ever can have put such notion as that into your head where in the world do you want to go toyou who are the one hope of the house your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign country nobody knows where and as soon as your back is turned these wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way and will share all your possessions among themselves stay where you are among your own people and do not go wandering and worrying your life out on the barren ocean
fear not nurse answered telemachus my scheme is not without heavens sanction but swear that you will say nothing about all this to my mother till i have been away some ten or twelve days unless she hears of my having gone and asks you for i do not want her to spoil her beauty by crying
the old woman swore most solemnly that she would not and when she had completed her oath she began drawing off the wine into jars and getting the barley meal into the bags while telemachus went back to the suitors
then minerva bethought her of another matter she took his shape and went round the town to each one of the crew telling them to meet at the ship by sundown she went also to noemon son of phronius and asked him to let her have a shipwhich he was very ready to do when the sun had set and darkness was over all the land she got the ship into the water put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry and stationed her at the end of the harbour presently the crew came up and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them
furthermore she went to the house of ulysses and threw the suitors into a deep slumber she caused their drink to fuddle them and made them drop their cups from their hands so that instead of sitting over their wine they went back into the town to sleep with their eyes heavy and full of drowsiness then she took the form and voice of mentor and called telemachus to come outside
telemachus said she the men are on board and at their oars waiting for you to give your orders so make haste and let us be off
on this she led the way while telemachus followed in her steps when they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side and telemachus said now my men help me to get the stores on board they are all put together in the cloister and my mother does not know anything about it nor any of the maid servants except one
with these words he led the way and the others followed after when they had brought the things as he told them telemachus went on board minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the vessel while telemachus sat beside her then the men loosed the hawsers and took their places on the benches minerva sent them a fair wind from the west that whistled over the deep blue waves whereon telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail and they did as he told them they set the mast in its socket in the cross plank raised it and made it fast with the forestays then they hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide as the sail bellied out with the wind the ship flew through the deep blue water and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward then they made all fast throughout the ship filled the mixing bowls to the brim and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from everlasting but more particularly to the greyeyed daughter of jove
thus then the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night from dark till dawn
telemachus visits nestor at pylos but as the sun was rising from the fair sea into the firmament of heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals they reached pylos the city of neleus now the people of pylos were gathered on the sea shore to offer sacrifice of black bulls to neptune lord of the earthquake there were nine guilds with five hundred men in each and there were nine bulls to each guild as they were eating the inward meats and burning the thigh bones on the embers in the name of neptune telemachus and his crew arrived furled their sails brought their ship to anchor and went ashore
minerva led the way and telemachus followed her presently she said telemachus you must not be in the least shy or nervous you have taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and how he came by his end so go straight up to nestor that we may see what he has got to tell us beg of him to speak the truth and he will tell no lies for he is an excellent person
but how mentor replied telemachus dare i go up to nestor and how am i to address him i have never yet been used to holding long conversations with people and am ashamed to begin questioning one who is so much older than myself
some things telemachus answered minerva will be suggested to you by your own instinct and heaven will prompt you further for i am assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth until now
she then went quickly on and telemachus followed in her steps till they reached the place where the guilds of the pylian people were assembled there they found nestor sitting with his sons while his company round him were busy getting dinner ready and putting pieces of meat on to the spits while other pieces were cooking when they saw the strangers they crowded round them took them by the hand and bade them take their places nestors son pisistratus at once offered his hand to each of them and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were lying on the sands near his father and his brother thrasymedes then he gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them into a golden cup handing it to minerva first and saluting her at the same time
offer a prayer sir said he to king neptune for it is his feast that you are joining when you have duly prayed and made your drink offering pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also i doubt not that he too lifts his hands in prayer for man cannot live without god in the world still he is younger than you are and is much of an age with myself so i will give you the precedence
as he spoke he handed her the cup minerva thought it very right and proper of him to have given it to herself first she accordingly began praying heartily to neptune o thou she cried that encirclest the earth vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants that call upon thee more especially we pray thee send down thy grace on nestor and on his sons thereafter also make the rest of the pylian people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering you lastly grant telemachus and myself a happy issue in respect of the matter that has brought us in our ship to pylos
when she had thus made an end of praying she handed the cup to telemachus and he prayed likewise by and by when the outer meats were roasted and had been taken off the spits the carvers gave every man his portion and they all made an excellent dinner as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink nestor knight of gerene began to speak
now said he that our guests have done their dinner it will be best to ask them who they are who then sir strangers are you and from what port have you sailed are you traders or do you sail the seas as rovers with your hand against every man and every mans hand against you
telemachus answered boldly for minerva had given him courage to ask about his father and get himself a good name
nestor said he son of neleus honour to the achaean name you ask whence we come and i will tell you we come from ithaca under neritum and the matter about which i would speak is of private not public import i seek news of my unhappy father ulysses who is said to have sacked the town of troy in company with yourself we know what fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at troy but as regards ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is dead at all for no one can certify us in what place he perished nor say whether he fell in battle on the mainland or was lost at sea amid the waves of amphitrite therefore i am suppliant at your knees if haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end whether you saw it with your own eyes or heard it from some other traveller for he was a man born to trouble do not soften things out of any pity for me but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw if my brave father ulysses ever did you loyal service either by word or deed when you achaeans were harassed among the trojans bear it in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all
my friend answered nestor you recall a time of much sorrow to my mind for the brave achaeans suffered much both at sea while privateering under achilles and when fighting before the great city of king priam our best men all of them fell thereajax achilles patroclus peer of gods in counsel and my own dear son antilochus a man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant but we suffered much more than this what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story though you were to stay here and question me for five years or even six i could not tell you all that the achaeans suffered and you would turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended nine long years did we try every kind of stratagem but the hand of heaven was against us during all this time there was no one who could compare with your father in subtletyif indeed you are his soni can hardly believe my eyesand you talk just like him toono one would say that people of such different ages could speak so much alike he and i never had any kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council but in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the argives how all might be ordered for the best
when however we had sacked the city of priam and were setting sail in our ships as heaven had dispersed us then jove saw fit to vex the argives on their homeward voyage for they had not all been either wise or understanding and hence many came to a bad end through the displeasure of joves daughter minerva who brought about a quarrel between the two sons of atreus
the sons of atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be for it was sunset and the achaeans were heavy with wine when they explained why they had called the people together it seemed that menelaus was for sailing homeward at once and this displeased agamemnon who thought that we should wait till we had offered hecatombs to appease the anger of minerva fool that he was he might have known that he would not prevail with her for when the gods have made up their minds they do not change them lightly so the two stood bandying hard words whereon the achaeans sprang to their feet with a cry that rent the air and were of two minds as to what they should do
that night we rested and nursed our anger for jove was hatching mischief against us but in the morning some of us drew our ships into the water and put our goods with our women on board while the rest about half in number stayed behind with agamemnon wethe other halfembarked and sailed and the ships went well for heaven had smoothed the sea when we reached tenedos we offered sacrifices to the gods for we were longing to get home cruel jove however did not yet mean that we should do so and raised a second quarrel in the course of which some among us turned their ships back again and sailed away under ulysses to make their peace with agamemnon but i and all the ships that were with me pressed forward for i saw that mischief was brewing the son of tydeus went on also with me and his crews with him later on menelaus joined us at lesbos and found us making up our minds about our coursefor we did not know whether to go outside chios by the island of psyra keeping this to our left or inside chios over against the stormy headland of mimas so we asked heaven for a sign and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to euboea this we therefore did and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage during the night to geraestus where we offered many sacrifices to neptune for having helped us so far on our way four days later diomed and his men stationed their ships in argos but i held on for pylos and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it fair for me
therefore my dear young friend i returned without hearing anything about the others i know neither who got home safely nor who were lost but as in duty bound i will give you without reserve the reports that have reached me since i have been here in my own house they say the myrmidons returned home safely under achilles son neoptolemus so also did the valiant son of poias philoctetes idomeneus again lost no men at sea and all his followers who escaped death in the field got safe home with him to crete no matter how far out of the world you live you will have heard of agamemnon and the bad end he came to at the hands of aegisthusand a fearful reckoning did aegisthus presently pay see what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to do as orestes did who killed false aegisthus the murderer of his noble father you too thenfor you are a tall smartlooking fellowshow your mettle and make yourself a name in story
nestor son of neleus answered telemachus honour to the achaean name the achaeans applaud orestes and his name will live through all time for he has avenged his father nobly would that heaven might grant me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors who are ill treating me and plotting my ruin but the gods have no such happiness in store for me and for my father so we must bear it as best we may
my friend said nestor now that you remind me i remember to have heard that your mother has many suitors who are ill disposed towards you and are making havoc of your estate do you submit to this tamely or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you who knows but what ulysses may come back after all and pay these scoundrels in full either singlehanded or with a force of achaeans behind him if minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to ulysses when we were fighting before troy for i never yet saw the gods so openly fond of any one as minerva then was of your father if she would take as good care of you as she did of him these wooers would soon some of them forget their wooing
telemachus answered i can expect nothing of the kind it would be far too much to hope for i dare not let myself think of it even though the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me
on this minerva said telemachus what are you talking about heaven has a long arm if it is minded to save a man and if it were me i should not care how much i suffered before getting home provided i could be safe when i was once there i would rather this than get home quickly and then be killed in my own house as agamemnon was by the treachery of aegisthus and his wife still death is certain and when a mans hour is come not even the gods can save him no matter how fond they are of him
mentor answered telemachus do not let us talk about it any more there is no chance of my fathers ever coming back the gods have long since counselled his destruction there is something else however about which i should like to ask nestor for he knows much more than any one else does they say he has reigned for three generations so that it is like talking to an immortal tell me therefore nestor and tell me true how did agamemnon come to die in that way what was menelaus doing and how came false aegisthus to kill so far better a man than himself was menelaus away from achaean argos voyaging elsewhither among mankind that aegisthus took heart and killed agamemnon
i will tell you truly answered nestor and indeed you have yourself divined how it all happened if menelaus when he got back from troy had found aegisthus still alive in his house there would have been no barrow heaped up for him not even when he was dead but he would have been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures and not a woman would have mourned him for he had done a deed of great wickedness but we were over there fighting hard at troy and aegisthus who was taking his ease quietly in the heart of argos cajoled agamemnons wife clytemnestra with incessant flattery
at first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme for she was of a good natural disposition moreover there was a bard with her to whom agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for troy that he was to keep guard over his wife but when heaven had counselled her destruction aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and left him there for crows and seagulls to batten uponafter which she went willingly enough to the house of aegisthus then he offered many burnt sacrifices to the gods and decorated many temples with tapestries and gilding for he had succeeded far beyond his expectations
meanwhile menelaus and i were on our way home from troy on good terms with one another when we got to sunium which is the point of athens apollo with his painless shafts killed phrontis the steersman of menelaus ship and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in rough weather so that he died then and there with the helm in his hand and menelaus though very anxious to press forward had to wait in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites presently when he too could put to sea again and had sailed on as far as the malean heads jove counselled evil against him and made it blow hard till the waves ran mountains high here he divided his fleet and took the one half towards crete where the cydonians dwell round about the waters of the river iardanus there is a high headland hereabouts stretching out into the sea from a place called gortyn and all along this part of the coast as far as phaestus the sea runs high when there is a south wind blowing but after phaestus the coast is more protected for a small headland can make a great shelter here this part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked but the crews just managed to save themselves as for the other five ships they were taken by winds and seas to egypt where menelaus gathered much gold and substance among people of an alien speech meanwhile aegisthus here at home plotted his evil deed for seven years after he had killed agamemnon he ruled in mycene and the people were obedient under him but in the eighth year orestes came back from athens to be his bane and killed the murderer of his father then he celebrated the funeral rites of his mother and of false aegisthus by a banquet to the people of argos and on that very day menelaus came home with as much treasure as his ships could carry
take my advice then and do not go travelling about for long so far from home nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house they will eat up everything you have among them and you will have been on a fools errand still i should advise you by all means to go and visit menelaus who has lately come off a voyage among such distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from when the winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning even birds cannot fly the distance in a twelvemonth so vast and terrible are the seas that they must cross go to him therefore by sea and take your own men with you or if you would rather travel by land you can have a chariot you can have horses and here are my sons who can escort you to lacedaemon where menelaus lives beg of him to speak the truth and he will tell you no lies for he is an excellent person
as he spoke the sun set and it came on dark whereon minerva said sir all that you have said is well now however order the tongues of the victims to be cut and mix wine that we may make drinkofferings to neptune and the other immortals and then go to bed for it is bed time people should go away early and not keep late hours at a religious festival
thus spoke the daughter of jove and they obeyed her saying men servants poured water over the hands of the guests while pages filled the mixingbowls with wine and water and handed it round after giving every man his drink offering then they threw the tongues of the victims into the fire and stood up to make their drink offerings when they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded minerva and telemachus were for going on board their ship but nestor caught them up at once and stayed them
heaven and the immortal gods he exclaimed forbid that you should leave my house to go on board of a ship do you think i am so poor and short of clothes or that i have so few cloaks and as to be unable to find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests let me tell you i have store both of rugs and cloaks and shall not permit the son of my old friend ulysses to camp down on the deck of a shipnot while i livenor yet will my sons after me but they will keep open house as i have done
then minerva answered sir you have spoken well and it will be much better that telemachus should do as you have said he therefore shall return with you and sleep at your house but i must go back to give orders to my crew and keep them in good heart i am the only older person among them the rest are all young men of telemachus own age who have taken this voyage out of friendship so i must return to the ship and sleep there moreover tomorrow i must go to the cauconians where i have a large sum of money long owing to me as for telemachus now that he is your guest send him to lacedaemon in a chariot and let one of your sons go with him be pleased to also provide him with your best and fleetest horses
when she had thus spoken she flew away in the form of an eagle and all marvelled as they beheld it nestor was astonished and took telemachus by the hand my friend said he i see that you are going to be a great hero some day since the gods wait upon you thus while you are still so young this can have been none other of those who dwell in heaven than joves redoubtable daughter the tritoborn who shewed such favour towards your brave father among the argives holy queen he continued vouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself my good wife and my children in return i will offer you in sacrifice a broadbrowed heifer of a year old unbroken and never yet brought by man under the yoke i will gild her horns and will offer her up to you in sacrifice
thus did he pray and minerva heard his prayer he then led the way to his own house followed by his sons and sons in law when they had got there and had taken their places on the benches and seats he mixed them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it as he mixed the wine he prayed much and made drink offerings to minerva daughter of aegisbearing jove then when they had made their drink offerings and had drunk each as much as he was minded the others went home to bed each in his own abode but nestor put telemachus to sleep in the room that was over the gateway along with pisistratus who was the only unmarried son now left him as for himself he slept in an inner room of the house with the queen his wife by his side
now when the child of morning rosyfingered dawn appeared nestor left his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble that stood in front of his house here aforetime sat neleus peer of gods in counsel but he was now dead and had gone to the house of hades so nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand as guardian of the public weal his sons as they left their rooms gathered round him echephron stratius perseus aretus and thrasymedes the sixth son was pisistratus and when telemachus joined them they made him sit with them nestor then addressed them
my sons said he make haste to do as i shall bid you i wish first and foremost to propitiate the great goddess minerva who manifested herself visibly to me during yesterdays festivities go then one or other of you to the plain tell the stockman to look me out a heifer and come on here with it at once another must go to telemachus ship and invite all the crew leaving two men only in charge of the vessel some one else will run and fetch laerceus the goldsmith to gild the horns of the heifer the rest stay all of you where you are tell the maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner and to fetch seats and logs of wood for a burnt offering tell them also to bring me some clear spring water
on this they hurried off on their several errands the heifer was brought in from the plain and telemachuss crew came from the ship the goldsmith brought the anvil hammer and tongs with which he worked his gold and minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice nestor gave out the gold and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty then stratius and echephron brought her in by the horns aretus fetched water from the house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it and in his other hand he held a basket of barley meal sturdy thrasymedes stood by with a sharp axe ready to strike the heifer while perseus held a bucket then nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley meal and he offered many a prayer to minerva as he threw a lock from the heifers head upon the fire
when they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal thrasymedes dealt his blow and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut through the tendons at the base of her neck whereon the daughters and daughters in law of nestor and his venerable wife eurydice she was eldest daughter to clymenus screamed with delight then they lifted the heifers head from off the ground and pisistratus cut her throat when she had done bleeding and was quite dead they cut her up they cut out the thigh bones all in due course wrapped them round in two layers of fat and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them then nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them while the young men stood near him with fivepronged spits in their hands when the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats they cut the rest of the meat up small put the pieces on the spits and toasted them over the fire
meanwhile lovely polycaste nestors youngest daughter washed telemachus when she had washed him and anointed him with oil she brought him a fair mantle and shirt and he looked like a god as he came from the bath and took his seat by the side of nestor when the outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen who kept pouring them out their wine in cups of gold as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink nestor said sons put telemachuss horses to the chariot that he may start at once
thus did he speak and they did even as he had said and yoked the fleet horses to the chariot the housekeeper packed them up a provision of bread wine and sweet meats fit for the sons of princes then telemachus got into the chariot while pisistratus gathered up the reins and took his seat beside him he lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth into the open country leaving the high citadel of pylos behind them all that day did they travel swaying the yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all the land then they reached pherae where diocles lived who was son to ortilochus and grandson to alpheus here they passed the night and diocles entertained them hospitably when the child of morning rosyfingered dawn appeared they again yoked their horses and drove out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse pisistratus lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth presently they came to the corn lands of the open country and in the course of time completed their journey so well did their steeds take them
now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land
